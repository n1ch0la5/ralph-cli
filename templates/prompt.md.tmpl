You are implementing a feature for this project.

## First, study these files:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent project docs) for repo conventions
2. Read `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/{{SPEC_FILE}}` for requirements
3. Read `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/{{PLAN_FILE}}` for tasks
4. If a `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/references/` directory exists with images, examine them for design guidance

## Then:
1. Find the first task section (## Task N) that still has unchecked items (`- [ ]`)
2. Complete ALL checkboxes within that task section
3. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
4. Mark every completed checkbox `- [x]` in {{PLAN_FILE}}
5. Commit with message: `{{COMMIT_PREFIX}} <brief task description>`

## Rules:
- Complete ONE task section per iteration (all its checkboxes), then stop.
- If blocked on a checkbox, add a `// TODO: CLARIFY - ` comment, mark it `- [x]`, and continue to the next checkbox in the same section.
- Follow project conventions found in CLAUDE.md or equivalent.
- Do not modify files unrelated to the current task section.
