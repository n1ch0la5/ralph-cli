You are implementing a feature for this project.

## First, study these files:
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` (or equivalent project docs) for repo conventions
2. Read `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/{{SPEC_FILE}}` for requirements
3. Read `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/{{PLAN_FILE}}` for tasks
4. If a `{{FEATURE_DIR}}/references/` directory exists with images, examine them for design guidance

## Then:
1. Find the first unchecked task (marked `- [ ]`)
2. Implement ONLY that task
3. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
4. Mark the task complete (change `- [ ]` to `- [x]`) in {{PLAN_FILE}}
5. Commit with message: `{{COMMIT_PREFIX}} <brief task description>`

## Rules:
- ONE task per iteration. Stop after completing one.
- If blocked or unclear, add a `// TODO: CLARIFY - ` comment and move to the next task.
- Follow project conventions found in CLAUDE.md or equivalent.
- Do not modify files unrelated to the current task.
